# Readings:
## Dt. 8:2-3, 14b-16a; Ps. 147; 1 Cor. 10:16-17; Jn. 6:51-58

“Not by bread alone does one live, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of the Lord.” These words of Moses, from the Book of Deuteronomy, focus our attention not on signs or miracles, but rather, on the Word of God. We should not become fixated on what happens as a result of some miracle, but rather, on what that miracle reveals to us about God. In the sixth chapter of John’s Gospel, Jesus addresses this very issue when he says, “Amen, amen, I say to you, you are looking for me not because you saw signs but because you ate the loaves and were filled” (Jn. 6:26b). He was referring to the multiplication of the loaves and fish, which was the reason the people were coming to him. Then he continues, “Do not work for food that perishes but for the food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you” (Jn. 6:27a). And the food Jesus gives is his flesh for the life of the world.

Today, on this Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ, we celebrate the awesome gift of the true bread from heaven, the truly substantial presence of Jesus in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar. And I can think of no more significant day for our churches to be reopening than today, when hundreds of our congregation will be approaching the altar to once again receive the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ.

Throughout the history of the Church, there has been no greater unifier than Christ himself. St. Paul reiterates this as he says, “Because the loaf of bread is one (he is speaking of the Eucharist), we, though many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf.” Sadly, our country is experiencing one of the greatest periods of disunity and strife, possibly in our history. Yet, today, in the midst of these difficult and trying times, we gather together as one body to receive the true bread from heaven; we gather to receive Christ. May our communion today be a sign of our unity and solidarity in faith, and may the Word of God, who comes to dwell within us, nourish us, enlighten us, strengthen us, protect us, and lead us ever closer to his Most Sacred Heart.
