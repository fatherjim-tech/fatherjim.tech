In this video, I discuss some of the troubling issues surrounding the use of ZOOM from a security and privacy standpoint. The fact that Eric Yuan, CEO of Zoom, openly supports abortion presents a serious moral concern for Catholics using the app. Should Catholics pay for a service from a company that openly supports the destruction of life? The answer should be clear. So, what is the Catholic to do? One possible solution is to use a Free and Open Source Software alternative such as Jitsi Meet. Watch to see Jitsi in action.
